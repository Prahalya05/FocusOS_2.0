# Notification Sound Setup

## Timer Sound File

To enable timer sound notifications, you need to add a notification sound file:

1. **Download a notification sound** (MP3 format, 1-3 seconds)
   - You can find free sounds at: https://freesound.org/
   - Or use a gentle chime/bell sound

2. **Rename the file to `notification.mp3`**

3. **Place it in this directory** (`apps/web/public/`)

4. **The timer will automatically use this sound** when sessions complete

## Alternative: Browser Notifications

If you don't add a sound file, the timer will still work and show browser notifications instead.

## Recommended Sound Types

- Gentle chime
- Soft bell
- Pleasant notification tone
- Calm alert sound

**Note:** Keep the file size under 500KB for fast loading.
